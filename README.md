# propel2-soft-delete-behavior

This "behavior" provides soft delete support for Propel2.  Soft deleting was deprecated in Propel2 in favor of the new archivable behavior.  Both have their drawbacks, but admittedly soft delete is a bit inferior.  This behavior will bring back the same Propel1 behavior API and support in Propel2.
